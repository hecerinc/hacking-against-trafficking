# Hacking Against Trafficking


Esto es una modificacion hecha por mi

This projects seeks to be the spiritual successor to the [Hacking Against Slavery](https://hackingagainstslavery.github.io/) project started by Eric Schles. Ideally, this will provide a toolkit that will help citizens and law enforcement agents to help identify cases of sexual trafficking around the world with the help of AI tools.
